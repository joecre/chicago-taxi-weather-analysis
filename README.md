# How Rain Affects Travel Time: A Taxi Ride Analysis from the Loop to O’Hare

## Overview

This project explores how rainy weather impacts taxi ride durations from downtown Chicago (The Loop) to O’Hare International Airport. The analysis focuses on whether average ride times on rainy Saturdays are significantly longer than on dry Saturdays. Understanding this relationship can help travelers and companies plan for delays due to weather conditions.

Using November 2017 taxi and weather data, I also explored the most active taxi companies and the busiest drop-off neighborhoods. Hypothesis testing was applied to determine if the difference in ride durations on rainy days is statistically significant.

## Key Insights

- Taxi rides on rainy Saturdays were significantly longer than those on dry Saturdays.
- A few taxi companies handled the majority of trips during the analysis period.
- The most popular drop-off neighborhoods were dense business and entertainment hubs like The Loop and River North.
